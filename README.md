This was my very first project and foray into machine learning and coding. I started this with little knowledge of coding, but I had confidence in my knowledge of finance and my ability to dedicate myself to learning something new and applicable for a future career. This page is a bit of a mess but generally the functions were built by myself with advice from mentors and friends with mroe experience than I in an attempt to recreate the N-LASR machine learning model that was built by Deutsche Bank, with the one major change being that I would be using technical indicatosr as pretty much my sole set of features. Over the months that it took me to build this around my studies I ended up creating a functional model that after optimising and backtesting I found to have at best a 53% winrate on my test set.

Since this model, and after having done further research, these results line up with what should be expected from thr use of purely technical indicators. Studies I have read seem to show that on average the effect of prior past movement is in no way indicative of future price movement, and attempting to predict price movement in the stock markets by only using technical indicators should result in that which I have found. Not much difference to random guess-work. However, this project has taught me much and I think it is quite interesting to record my relatively juvenile first attempts at coding develop into a functional model.
